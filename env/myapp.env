# APPNAME - the name you want the user to use to invoke it
#           For example if APPNAME is myapp then user will invoke the app as <host:port>/myapp.
#           If you are using rafserver as a proxy make sure your appname is not same as onf ot the points
#           in the  downstream server(ex: Do not name your app "reports', 'files' etc...

APPNAME=myapp

#
# Location of the application resources(html, shared resources etc...)
# each APPNAME corresponds to a sub-directory directory in this location with the same name as APPNAME.
# if current directory then set APPLOC to .

# A good standard is to use index.html
