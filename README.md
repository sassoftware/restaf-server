# Servers for use with SAS Viya

This package has two servers:

1. restaf-server - Use this for developing an app server for web applications(see packages/app)
2. viya-api-server-nodejs - Use this to develop rest api servers(see packages/api)

> The restaf-server will be soon super-seeded by viya-app-server with better support for protecting all routes
